# AdventOfCode2020
This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Solutions in TypeScript, because that's what I'm playing around with in 2020.

## Setup

You'll need `npm`, `typescript` and `ts-node`. Install npm as per your operating system and distro instructions. Then, run `npm install` on the checked repository working dir. Optionally, install GNU Make.

## Execution

Either `make day1` or `npx ts-node src/day1/index.ts`. Replace `day1` with the relevant day.
